The cutting-edge web shop project presents a remarkable e-commerce platform built with React, Commerce.js backend API, and Stripe payment gateway integration. This web-shop provides a sleek, intuitive, and secure online shopping experience.

Utilizing the power of React, I have crafted a responsive and dynamic user interface that provides seamless navigation and a delightful shopping journey. Material-UI icons, core components, and styled components such as InputLabel, Select, Button, Grid, MenuItem, Typography, Divider, and Grid ensures consistent, nice design across the entire platform.

With Commerce.js as the backbone of the backend API, I have harnessed its robust features to manage product listings, inventory, and order processing efficiently. The seamless integration with Stripe allows web-shop's customers to securely handle payments and securely store banking card credentials.

To enhance code reusability and maintainability, a separate CustomTextField component was developed, intelligently designed to handle form inputs in address forms. By employing this component, I ensured code modularity while dynamically passing name and label props to FormInput component. Leveraging React's Controller, it provides smooth text input handling and rendering, resulting in optimized performance and a streamlined user experience.
